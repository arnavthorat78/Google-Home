This website's main feature is the Search page. In there, you can search, type URLs, or use the built-in Smart feature. Also, if your browser supports it, version 1.4.0 of the website lauched voice commands, so if your browser supports it, you can actually speak whatever you want to Search or speak your Smart commands as well!

Version 2.0.0 is about to be released, and this is a major point, as we have moved from version 1 to version 2! We have gone through so much, and it is very exciting! We will have a large celebration once that version is released!
