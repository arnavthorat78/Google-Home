# Google-Home
This project is all about Google Home!

See the following URL for the online version of this website: https://arnavthorat78.github.io/Google-Home/.

This website is very helpful for searching, typing URLs, and also using Smart features all in one website! You can also sign in or sign up so that you can save your data and also get a more personalised website.

Now, you can see the bottom information for seeing how to use this website.

This website can be used for searching, typing URLs, and also the built-in Smart feature!
You can also use Accounts with this website to save your data, such as previous searches and a personalised website (e.g. Hello, User!).
Please keep in mind that you need to give permissions to the website (which is redirects, for the searches and URLs). You can get the steps from the Google Home website, from the link above.
You can also see updates and about information from the navigation bar on the top of the webpage.
To sign in, you need to have an account. If you don't, then you need to sign up. You can do this by navigating to the navbar and clicking sign up (on the right side, with the person icon). However, if you do have an account, then sign up with your credentials so that you can have your information across multiple devices.

More information about this website will be posted later.
