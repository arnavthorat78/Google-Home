This website is all about Google Home!

See the following URL for the online version of this website: https://arnavthorat78.github.io/Google-Home/.

This website is very helpful for searching, typing URLs, and also using Smart features all in one website! You can also sign in or sign up so that you can save your data and also get a more personalised website.

Now, you can see the bottom information for seeing how to use this website.

This website's main feature is the Search page. In there, you can search, type URLs, or use the built-in Smart feature. Also, if your browser supports it, version 1.4.0 of the website lauched voice commands, so if your browser supports it, you can actually speak whatever you want to Search or speak your Smart commands as well!

Version 1.5.0 lauched a better account experience, so your data is more secure and also your signing experience is more better. For instance, in version 1.1.0, when we first launched accounts, you had to sign in after signing up. But know, after you sign up, everything is done!

There are way more features of the website, and there will also be way more coming!

Sneak-peak: Version 1.6.0 might announce Settings!

More information about this site will be posted later when more updates have concluded. But for now, keep searching!
